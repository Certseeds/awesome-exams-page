Let $V$ be a real inner product space. A function $f: V \rightarrow V$ is called a rigid motion if

$$
\|f(x)-f(y)\|=\|x-y\|
$$

for all $x, y \in V$. For example, any isometry on a finite-dimensional real inner product space is a rigid motion. Another class of rigid motions are the translations.

A function $g: V \rightarrow V$, where $V$ is a real inner product space, is called a translation if there exists a vector $v_{0} \in V$ such that $g(v)=v+v_{0}$ for all $v \in V$. Let $f: V \rightarrow V$ be a rigid motion on a finite-dimensional real inner product space $V$, show that there exists a unique isometry $T$ on $V$ and a unique translation $g$ on $V$ such that $f=g \circ T$
