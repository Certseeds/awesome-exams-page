## 一

Let $k$ be a field and $\text{Fin Vect}_k$ the collection of all finite dimensional vector spaces over $k$

Let $S:= \text{Fin Vect}_k$

Consider a relation $\sim$ over $S$ defined by

$$
(V, W) \sim(V^{\prime}, W^{\prime}) \text { if and only if } V \oplus W^{\prime} \cong V^{\prime} \oplus W
$$

### 1-1

Prove that $\backsim$ is an equivalent relation.

In other words,

1. $a \sim a$
2. $a \sim b$ implies $b \sim a$
3. $a \sim b$ and $b \sim c$ implies $a \sim c$

### 1-2

Calculate SXS／$\backsim$

In other words, find all equivalence classes, and find a representative(will be refered to as distinguished represantative in other subproblems) for each equivalence class

### 1-3

For $(V, W),(V^{\prime}, W^{\prime}) \in S X S$, let

$$
(V, W) \oplus(V^{\prime}, W^{\prime}):=(V \oplus V^{\prime}, W \oplus W^{\prime})
$$

Prove that it induces a well-defined map on the quotient SXS／$\backsim$

Moreover,  describe the map $\oplus$ explicitly using the representatives you found in 1-2 (i.e.

for each distinguished representative( $V, W$ )and each distinguished representative $(V^{\prime}, W^{\prime})$, find a distinguished representative $(V^{\prime \prime}, W^{\prime \prime})$ such that $(V, W) \oplus(V^{\prime}, W^{\prime})$ is equivalent to $(V^{\prime \prime}, W^{\prime \prime})$

### 1-4

For $(V, W),(V^{\prime}, W^{\prime}) \in S X S$, let

$(V, W) \otimes(V^{\prime}, W^{\prime}):=((V \otimes V^{\prime}) \oplus(W \otimes W^{\prime}),(V \otimes W^{\prime}) \oplus(V^{\prime} \otimes W))$

Prove that it induces a well-defined map on the quotient SXS／$\backsim$.

Moreover,  describe the map $\otimes$ explicitly using the representatives you found in 1-2

## 二

Let $A, B$ be submodules of some $k$-module $X$ .Prove that

$$
\frac{A+B}{B} \cong \frac{A}{A \cap B}
$$

## 三

Let $k$ be a field and consider $k[x]$ .Let $f \in k[x]$ be a fixed monic polynomial.Recall that, for $g \in k[x]$ such that $f$ and $g$ are coprime in $k[x]$, if we run Euclidean algorithm on $f$ and $g$, we can find $p, q \in k[x]$ such that

$$
p f+q g=1
$$

Now, consider $R:=k[x] /(f)$ .Then, the formula above gives

$$
q g=1
$$

in $R$, where $q, g, 1$ are treated as their equivalence classes in $R=k[x] /(f)$

In other words, for every $g$ that is coprime with $f$ in k[i], there exists $g^{-1}$ in $R$

Moreover, this $g^{-1}$ can be calculated using Euclidean algorithm.

Let $f=x^{4}+x^{3}+x^{2}+x+1$ . For each of the following $g$,

+ iii: $g=x^{2}$
+ iv: $g=x^{3}$

## 四

Let $k$ be a field, and let $a_{0}, \cdots, a_{n-1} \in k$. Consider the $n \times n$ matrix $A$ given by

$$
A_{i j}= \begin{cases}a_{j-i}, & i \leq j, \\ 0, & i>j\end{cases}
$$

### 4-1

Calculate the minimal polynomial of $A$ when $a_{1}=1$ (assume that $n \geq 2$ )

### 4-2

### 4-4

## 五

For a k-module $M$, let $l_{M}: M \rightarrow M^{* *}$ given by $m \mapsto e v_{m}$,

where $\mathrm{ev}_{m}$ : $M^{*} \rightarrow k$ given by $f \mapsto f(m)$.

For $f \in \operatorname{Hom}(M, N)$, let $f^{* *} \in \operatorname{Hom}(M^{* *}, N^{* *})$ be the double dual of $f$

### 5-1

Prove that  $l_{N}$ $o$ $f$ = $f^{* *}$ $o$ $l_{m}$ as elements in Hom(M, $N^{* *}$)

### 5-2

Suppose that $M$ has a basis $b_{1}, \cdots, b_{d}$. Let $b_{1}^{*}, \cdots, b_{d}^{*} \in M^{*}$ be the dual basis of $b_{1}, \cdots, b_{d}$. Let $b_{1}^{* *}, \cdots, b_{d}^{* *} \in M^{* *}$ be the dual basis of $b_{1}^{*}, \cdots, b_{\alpha}^{*}$. Prove that $\operatorname{lm}(b_{i})=b_{i}^{* *}$

## 六

Let $M$ be a finite free $k$-module equipped with a homomorphism $\Delta=M \rightarrow M \otimes M$. Let $\operatorname{idm} \in \operatorname{Hom}(M, M)$ be the identity map on $M$. The pair $(M, \Delta)$ is called coormmutative if the following diagram commutes

``` mermaid
graph TD;
    M[Left-Up] --> |$\Delta$| $M \otimes N$ [Right-Up]
    M[Left-Up] --> |$\Delta$| $M \otimes M$ [Left-Down]
    $M \otimes N$ --> |$Delta \otimes id_{m}$| $M \otimes M \otimes M$ [Right-Down]
    $M \otimes M$ --> |$id_{m} \otimes \Delta$| $M \otimes M \otimes M$ [Right-Down]
```

(Recall that for $f \in \operatorname{Hom}(A, A^{\prime})$ and $g \in \operatorname{Hom}(B, B^{\prime})$, we define $f \otimes g \in \operatorname{Hom}(A \otimes B, B^{\prime} \otimes B^{\prime})$ given by $(f \otimes g)(a \otimes b):=f(a) \otimes g(b)$.)

### 6-1

Suppose that $M$ has basis $a, b, c, d$, and define the homomorphism $\Delta$ as follows

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \Delta=M \rightarrow M \otimes M \\
& a \mapsto a \otimes a+b \otimes c \\
& b \mapsto a \otimes b+b \otimes d \\
& c \mapsto c \otimes a+d \otimes c \\
& d \mapsto c \otimes b+d \otimes d
\end{aligned}
$$

Prove that it is cocommutative

### 6-2

Consider the map $\phi \in \operatorname{Hom}(M^{*} \otimes M^{*}, M^{*})$ given by

$$
\phi(f \otimes g)=(m \mapsto(f \otimes g)(\Delta(m))
$$

We call the pair $(M^{*}, \phi)$ commutative if $\phi(f \otimes g)=\phi(g \otimes f)$ for all $f, g \in M^{*}$. Prove that, $(M^{*}, \phi)$ is commutative if and only if $(M, \Delta)$ is cocommutative

## 七

Let $k$ be an integral domain (ie. for $a, b \in k, a b=0$ implies either $a=0$ or $b=0$ ). Let $M$ be a $k$-module, and $B \in(M, M^{*})$. We call $B$

+ reflexive if $B(x, y)=0$ implies that $B(y, x)=0$ for all $x, y \in M$
+ symmetric if $B(x, y)=B(y, x)$ for all $x, y \in M$
+ alternating if $B(x, y)=0$ for all $x \in M$

The goal of this problem is to prove that:

$B$ is reflexive if and only if $B$ is either symmetric or alternating

The sufficiency is easy, and you do not need to provide a proof. You are asked to prove the necessity by proving the following statements. Assume now that $B$ is reflexive

### 7-1

For all $x, y, z \in M$

$$
B(x, y) B(z, x)=B(x, z) B(y, x)
$$

### 7-2

For all $x, y \in M$, if $B(x, x) \neq 0$, then

$$
B(x, y)=B(y, x)
$$

### 7-3

Suppose that for some $x, y \in M, B(x, y) \neq B(y, x)$. If $B(z, z) \neq 0$ for some $z \in M$, then

$$
B(x+z, x+z)=0
$$

### 7-4

Prove that if $B$ is either symmetric or alternating

## 八

Suppose that

$$
\langle e_{i}, e_{j}\rangle=j-i
$$

for $1 \leq i \leq j \leq n$

### 8-1

### 8-2

Assume that $n=5$ and $M$ is alternating. Find an explicit basis for $M$ under which the Gram matrix is block diagonal matrix, where each block is either the $2 \times 2$ alternating matrix with diagnoal entries 0 and anti-diagonal entries $\pm 1$, or $|x|$ matrix with a single entry 0
