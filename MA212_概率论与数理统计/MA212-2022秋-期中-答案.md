Part Three - Question Answering

1. A student takes two consecutive exams for the same course. The probability of passing the first exam is $p$. If the student passes for the first exam, the probability of passing the second exam is $p$ too; if the student fails the first exam, the probability of passing for the second time is $\frac{p}{2}$.

(1) If the student passes the exam at least once, then he can obtain the qualification. Find the probability that he will obtain the qualification;

(2) If it is known that the student passed for the second exam, find the probability that he passed the first exam.

2. There are two boxes, the first box contains 2 red balls and 1 white balls, and the second box contains half red balls and half white balls. Take a ball from each of the two boxes and put them together, then take a ball from it.

(1) Find the probability that the ball is a red ball;

(2) If the ball is found to be a red ball, find the probability that the ball drawn from the first box is red.

3. A room has 3 windows of the same size, and only one of them is open. A bird flew into the room from the open window, it can only fly out from the open window. Birds are flying around the house trying to get out of the room. Assuming the bind has no memory, it flies to the windows randomly.

(1) Denote by $X$ the number of times that the birds has tried in order to fly out of the room, find the frequency function of $X$;

(2) The owner claims that a bird he keeps has a memory and that it does not

attempt to fly to any window more than once. Let $Y$ represent the number of times that this clever bird has tried to fly out of the room. As the owner said, it is indeed, try to find the frequency function of $Y$;

(3) Find the probability that the number of test flights $X$ is less than $Y$.

4. Let the density function of $X$ be $f(x)=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}k x^{2}, & 0 \leq x<3, \\ 0, & \text { others, }\end{array}\right.$. Let $Y= \begin{cases}2, & X \leq 1, \\ X, & 1 x<x<2, \\ 1, & X \geqslant 2 .\end{cases}$
